# Game Specification – Beekeeper Idle

## High Concept

A web-based idle clicker with a 3D isometric (Diablo-style) view where players grow and evolve beehives into an automated apiary ecosystem.

## Core Pillars

- Idle-first progression (offline & automation matter)
- Hive evolution changes rules, not just numbers
- Calm, readable, slightly nerdy tone
- 3D world is contextual, UI does the heavy lifting

## Core Loop

1. Interact with hives (click / assign)
2. Generate honey and secondary resources
3. Upgrade and evolve hives
4. Automate production
5. Prestige (Research Seasons)

## Camera & Perspective

- Perspective camera
- Fixed angle (no rotation)
- Pan and zoom allowed
- Isometric / Diablo-like feel

## Identity Model

- No accounts, no email
- Client-generated cryptographic key
- Key = identity
- User responsible for backup

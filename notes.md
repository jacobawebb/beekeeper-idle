1. Hive position is currently grid based, it needs to be random but far enough away from existing hives.
2. The trees, and rocks need a revamp, they've very isometric and need to be more detail but in a cartoon way. There's also no flowers etc. Think beemovie style.
3. Maybe related to the bees being frozen but numbers don't display properly, the ones that show how much each hive is generating.
4. Currently it's way to easy to buy loads of hives and the more hives you buy the more expensive the upgrades should be or it's all to easy.
